# Additional Steps
For the most part the assembly remains the same. I didnt have a hard time gluing up the joints and assembling the whole camera. 3D printers have gotten better and with the slicer settings in the attached .3fm file there should not be any major changes. Some additional steps include : 
- glue the camera body together - I ended up sanding the faces a bit before gluing but the tolderences are fine enough for it to not need that. 
- Same goes for the door
- I did put some modellers putty from Tamiya that I used to get a flush finish again not necessary
- I also did spray paint the inside of my camera black - again not necessary. 
- I removed the CAMERADACTYL logo at the back since the letters looked kind of wierd after a glue up. I later put stikers with a labelmaker for that. 
- There is a frame counter dail that I made as a 3D part with the numbers engraved in it. Its a nice touch - I filled it in with white nail polish to get a decent looking result. 
- I used a 150mm lens which is a bit hard to just point and shoot. So there is an Iphone 15 adapter that acts as a viewfinder with the [Viewfinder App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/viewfinder-preview/id1216484605)

# Additional Files 
All the new STLs for printing are in A1_mini_files for printing. 
The 3fm file along with the blender files for the parts (assuming you have blender) are also provided. There is also a master file using rhinoceros - this is what I primarily use for CAD modelling.

# Credits 

All credits go to Cameradactyl and his original brancopan camera. I've just made changes to adapt it to my 3D printer and then made a few minor QOL tweaks.
